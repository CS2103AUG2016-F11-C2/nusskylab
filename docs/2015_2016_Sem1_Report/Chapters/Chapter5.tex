\chapter{Feedback}

\textit{Feedback} is for evaluated teams to evaluate the \textit{Peer Evaluations} they have received and it is also a very important component in determining whether the evaluator team can pass or not. After realizing the lack of extensibility in the design for \textit{PeerEvaluations} and with more time available for implementation of \textit{Feedback}, a Survey Template and question creation system has been set up, which made the system open for extensions for more questions and even question types.
