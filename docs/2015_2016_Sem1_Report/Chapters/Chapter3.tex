\chapter{Submission}

Students in Orbital are supposed to report their progress regarding their project for each milestone and they will be therefore submit submissions to describe what they have done. Basically a submission contains 3 parts:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Read me: highlights what are the changes and new features in the project.
  \item Project Log: a summary of work done during the phase and time used for each task.
  \item Video link: a link to a video introducing the project to evaluators.
\end{itemize}

As the structure of \textit{Read me} and \textit{Project Log} is free and we should allow creativity of students when it comes to describing their own projects, we decided to support rich text for submissions and there are some issues coming along this decision. What is more, during use of Skylab, many good suggestions were brought up students and advisers and this brings user experience issue.

\section{Usability}
