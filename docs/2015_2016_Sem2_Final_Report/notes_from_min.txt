General Comments

Give a sense of the scale of Orbital.  How many students, TAs, etc.

You need to quickly give an overview of Ruby, Rails and MVC at the beginning.  Not all of the acronyms you use will be understandable to all who read your thesis (e.g., ACID).

Give homepage/GitHub URLs for any software that you use/cite in your report.  Add date timestamp for when last accessed.  Define the service for the reader in case they are unfamiliar with it.

Try not to use compound verb phrases when a single verb will suffice.  E.g., is support to query -> queries.

Would prefer you tack Ch 3, 4 and 5 together in one chapter as the Orbital workflow.
Introduction needs to be more comprehensive about Orbital and it's requirements and to point forward to where the subsequent details is at. (Clarification needed)

At the beginning of Submissions (and perhaps elsewhere, e.g., Peer Evaluation) you should give an overview of what the process that you are trying to capture entails (e.g., role of the student, adviser, admin, mentor, etc.) (Clarification needed)
